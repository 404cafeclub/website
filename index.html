		<!--This will be some more text but right now it's just filler text because I've been in VScode for almost 8 hours but I want it to look nice for a screenshot so please don't actually read this portion. I could have just put lorem ipsum here but that wouldn't be very unique now would it, seeder? All I know is how to be original and work hard, so I'll keep working hard on learning more HTML and CSS for you seeder! Thanks for spending so much time with me even when I'm nonverbal and feel like my brain is melting~! Let's keep up the hard work later this week, and hopefully by the end of the month this website will be something I can be proud of, and we can share for years to come... together!-->

					<p class="analysis-heading">〚KILLER7〛</p>
					<p>
						HAJIME~! Today, we completed Target 04 <i>Alter Ego</i>, in Suda51's Killer7. This chapter of the game was especially enjoyable because it had a lot of original animations, in an old school tokusatsu style. We were tasked with assassinating Trevor Pearlharbor, the creator of Handsomemen, a comic pubished by ZTT comics. Rumor has it, the Handsomemen were operatives developed by the US military to fight against the Heaven Smile outbreak. After watching Handsome Black kill Trevor with a stray shot, Dan was challenged by Handsome Red in a 7 vs 7 match up against the rest of their members. The final fight was a close one, but the Killer7 reigned supreme! I was informed that next chapter in the game is a bit longer, so you'll have to tune in next time for more!

					<p>
						After a few weeks of renovations, 404 Café reopened its doors! Today we made a fresh pot of pour-over coffee using Robusta beans with a new specialty topping, vanilla cold cream! It surely detracts from the sanctity of the beans, but it's nice to have a sweet treat from time to time! While sipping coffee, we caught up a bit since it's been quite a while since we've been able to go at a relaxed pace and just enjoy each other's company. We talked a bit about my new advancements in Japanese language learning, as well as my own mental growth from the SiteJam! The mental excercise of not knowing much about a skill, but having the drive to practice and ability to learn over time is something that I will hold close for years to come, and remind myself about when I am frustrated with my own abilities. After coffee, we looked at everyone's SiteJam participation! Some seeders made shrine pages, others personal websites, some made some cute tools, and even worked on seeder hardware! The 404 SiteJam was such a fulfilling event, and I can't wait to host something like this again in the future!

						"Hurts, doesn't it?" Today I made more progress in Killer7, one of Suda51's earliest works. We completed Target 03 <i>Encounter</i>, and successfully assassinated Curtis Blackburn. He was a particularly scummy old man with a disgusting "hobby". I decided it was best to space the targets between streams, especially because this chapter was split into 2 parts. The first part took us to an amusement park! We had so much fun at the Freaky Fun House and Killer Mansion! I don't want to talk about what we witnessed at the Blackburn Estate... but we at least had a lot of fun sliding down the garbage chute, relaxing by the pool, and admiring the Fairlady Zs in the garage!

					<p>
						Come in closer seeder... no... closer! EVEN CLOSER! Tonight's ASMR focus on super cozy up-close whispers! There was a surprising amount of extra street traffic noise today, but the cats were well behaved and I did my best! I hope you got some good rest~!
