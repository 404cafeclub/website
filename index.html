		<!--This will be some more text but right now it's just filler text because I've been in VScode for almost 8 hours but I want it to look nice for a screenshot so please don't actually read this portion. I could have just put lorem ipsum here but that wouldn't be very unique now would it, seeder? All I know is how to be original and work hard, so I'll keep working hard on learning more HTML and CSS for you seeder! Thanks for spending so much time with me even when I'm nonverbal and feel like my brain is melting~! Let's keep up the hard work later this week, and hopefully by the end of the month this website will be something I can be proud of, and we can share for years to come... together!-->

					Café doors open once again! I was away for a few days last week, so I wanted to catch up a bit and share stories about what I was up to while I was gone! In order to get a bit of a break and escape the city a bit, I went to the mountains north of the city of angels! While there, I went hiking for the first time, so I shared the best photo I was able to take while climbing! The clouds were so close, the sky was blue, and the fresh air at higher altitude was so nice. I'm admittedly already trying to plan my next hike! I made some more coffee to share, trying to use up more of the Robusta beans I got from a friend whose family owns their own roastery! I hope you enjoyed using the
