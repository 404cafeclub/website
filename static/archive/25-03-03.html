                                    "Hurts, doesn't it?" Today I made more progress in Killer7, one of Suda51's earliest works. We completed Target 03 <i>Encounter</i>, and successfully assassinated Curtis Blackburn. He was a particularly scummy old man with a disgusting "hobby". I decided it was best to space the targets between streams, especially because this chapter was split into 2 parts. The first part took us to an amusement park! We had so much fun at the Freaky Fun House and Killer Mansion! I don't want to talk about what we witnessed at the Blackburn Estate... but we at least had a lot of fun sliding down the garbage chute, relaxing by the pool, and admiring the Fairlady Zs in the garage!

                                    Come in closer seeder... no... closer! EVEN CLOSER! Tonight's ASMR focus on super cozy up-close whispers! There was a surprising amount of extra street traffic noise today, but the cats were well behaved and I did my best! I hope you got some good rest~!
