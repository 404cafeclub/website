                                    Time for more adventures in Vana'diel! Since we last streamed, I spent some time leveling my Ninja, unlocking various ninjutsu, and making sure I had all of the ninja tools I needed to cast them! Today's goal was to reach Rank 4 in Bastok, our home city! After meeting up together, we adventured to Beaudeaux, to clear a mission in which we needed to kill 20 Copper Quadavs. They're a kind of turtle-like race of beastmen. Since one of our party members was severely underleveled, we took a bit longer to achieve our task. While there, I made a few very chuuni macros for my ninja. One of the best moves as a ninja is to create shadow clones, and I added some flavor text along the lines of my shadows covering up my loneliness... only to be overshadowed by Shimada's Samurai haikus. *SIGH* Our next quest was to scale up Delkfutt's Tower, our first dungeon! Lily very stubbornly wanted to farm for XP while there, while the rest of us insisted we scale to where we need to be to beat the boss monster as soon as possible! After much pleading and countless pit-stops, we beat the boss, acuqired keys, and saved a member of the Bastok Consolate! Rank 4 GET~! The last few hours of stream were spent unlocking access to the past, which was needed especially to unlock the dancer class. I was surprised to see how much more colorful Vana'diel was 20 years prior the current era! While chatting, Maple told us about Skillchains, something that she said she never really understood since she's always played magic-users. Since Shimada and I are playing as a Ninja and Samurai, we decided to try to practice synergizing a bit, and when we finally achieved a successful Skillchain... both of us died shortly after. After getting re-raised again, we had some more successful attempts at Skillchains! Thus, the stream came to and end and our adventures were paused until next time!

                                    Spring is officially here, can you believe it?! I had been feeling a bit out of sorts the last few days, but my love for the warmer seasons fired me up to bloom into my own new lease on life this spring! I woked hard behind the scenes this week on putting together a new springtime look for my 3DVR model. What did you think of my sheer flowly white dress with ruffled straps, strong heavy combat boots, and my hair tied in a side ponytail, seeder? I felt so comfy and cute in my new dress, especially since I got to show it off to you while we adventured around~! We rode in a hot air balloon, admired the cherry blossoms blooming, ate some food outdoor at a cozy spring time café, and even shared an umbrella together in the rain before going our separate ways at the train station! I had so much fun with you today... I'll keep today's date as a special memory for as long as possible!

                                    Café doors opened again today, though a bit later than usual since I was up really late hunting monsters the night before! Today's roast was more of my house Robusta, this time with a slightly different ratio of coffee to water! I usually brew pour-over using a 1:16 ratio. Since the Robusta beans are a bit older now and not as fresh, I wanted to make sure the results didn't taste too weak, so I opted to brew today's pot of coffee with a 1:14 ratio! It tasted great~! Bold, but still very smooth and easy to drink~! I was a bit low on energy and still had work to do offline, but I still wanted to create something together! Therefore, I folded a few pieces of origami paper from a set that was sent to me by a seeder~ We folded two cats, a bird cage, and a ribbon themed after Kiki's Delivery Service~ I got pretty hungry at one point, so after a break I served up some cheese tortellini with homemade tomato sauce, and a pork sauage あらばき bun from a local bakery with some bold iced green tea! Thanks for having a relaxing time with me today~ let's drink more coffee together soon!

                                    Tonight was a collab with Shimada and Clio! Usually we'd be joined by Yozora, but since she was busy we did our best as a party of three~ None of us had made it to high rank yet, so after chatting and doing some warm up hunts, we successfully hunted the last few monsters in the main story! Afterwards, we did some high rank missions together, including hunting our first ever Rathian. I'm still trying to figure out many of the mechanics of the game outside of wielding my weapond, and even then I've got plenty of room for improvement. However, I was still able to show off a bit with my own PoV today, making the use of my bread and butter combo as an Insect Glaive hunter. I even dodged a fire attack by vaulting in the air! Pretty cool, huh seeder?

                                    Tonight's ASMR wasn't particularly innovative, but at the same time was a strong stream for sure! The cats were especially rowdy, but I did my best to ensure you could relax and rest really well. I used some of my favorite soft brushes, a cozy blanket, and leaned in and whispered in your ear as close as possible. Did you rest well, seeder?
