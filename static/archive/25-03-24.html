                                    After a few days offline on my own adventure, I met with Maple, Lily, and Shimada once more in Vana'diel! After making a few preparations, we decided to try to fight an instanced Notorious Monster in a mission called Petrifying Pair! Our first attempt failed, but we were successful the second attempt! The mission requires the defeat of two lizards, Kilioa & Kalamainu! We chose this fight specifically because there was a chance it would drop a specific scroll for the improved version of my shadow clone ninjustsu, Utsusemi: Ni! We didn't get the rare scroll, but some really good boots did drop that have good stats for me to depend on as a Ninja! Afterwards, we began Chains of Promotheia, the first of many expansions on the main story! It took us to a very cool new area, full of a type of enemies called "empties", which were a bit spooky but I found charming! With Maple as our guide, we trekked further until we cleared the area! There are a few more areas to clear still, but we decided it was time to take a break and have some fun... so we all ventured on a boat called a manaclipper to Bibiki Bay, the only place where you can go clamming! My bucket broke on my 3 times, but the Bay itself had tons of beautiful PS2 beach graphics, so I wasn't too heartbroken about it!

                                    "Fusion, Synthesis, Coalescence" That's the tag line for this newly released music game from start-up Japanese company AXTORM! A friend of mine has been working hard on developing this game with many other talented music gamers and in-house artists! They reached out to me and asked if I'd be interested in doing a sponsored stream to show off the game and especially share it's fun to the English speaking world! It's a bit gimmicking, since the game has two lanes which converge into one, but the current song list and featured artists are some of the best I've seen in a PC music game! Check out MASH VP! RE:VISION on steam today!

                                    Monday again? NO PROBLEM! 404 Café doors are open and coffee is being brewed! Today's Robusta pour-over was served with you choices of a blueberry muffin, ham and cheese bun, or garlic cheese bun from a local bakery here in the City of Angels! While sipping our coffee, I shared all of the fanart I've received over the past few months! I'm so happy to have inspipred so many artists and seeders to either create art of me or commission art on my behalf! THANK YOU! We had some chats after, about philosophy and my own attempts at digging deeper into my own ego now that I feel more confident than I have in many many years. I shared some of my favorite quotes from Marcus Aurelius' <i>Meditations</i>, which is a compilations of the Roman Emperor's notes of himself and ideas, published posthumously. It's been a really enjoyable read, so I recommend it! After cleaning off the counter a bit, I was in the mood to play some games with you casually! First, I showed off my latest guilty pleasure, an indie game called Nubby's Number Factory. It's giving early 2000s CD-ROM with 1001 untitled games, and is honestly pretty goofy looking, but it's been fun to just play a bit of when winding down! Some seeders were worried about my work life balance, especially after one particularly grueling shift at the numbers factory... so we switched over to Monster Hunter Wilds! It's the first time I've had a chance to really play with you, so I opened a lobby and pushed further into High Rank! My PC crashed at one point, but after rebooting we played a bit more... until my PC crash agained. That's the curse of streaming unoptimized AAA games I suppose! Either way, hunting together was a blast, I even started learning Swtich Axe at the end!
