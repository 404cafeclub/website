						OTSU-SITEJAM!! We made it to the end of the month seeder! There's still plenty of room for improvement, but thanks to your help and support my website is a reality! Today we attacked the final boss of the site jam, my blog. We didn't quite get it ready to be published, but a lot of hard work was done and a lot was worked on so progress was made! We'll be showing off everyone's participation next week, since I really wanted to use the entirety of this month on my own website. I'm really proud of myself for what I was able to achieve, how much I learned, and the current results of my website! I can't wait to keep devolping it over time, this time... much slower. I'm pretty tired after a month straight of coding!!! Let's goof off and have LOTS of fun in March! Don't worry, I'll keep updating my scheduled on the homepage, and the analysis each stream so you won't miss out on ANYTHING! I still need to figure out how to host each month's stream analysis, but that's a task for this weekend! WE DID IT~!! YIPPEE!!

						It's Monster Hunter Wilds release time~! I've been super excited for the release of the most
						recent installment in the Monster Hunter franchise! This is my first time ever streaming a game
						immediately at launch! While making our way through the first bit of the game's main story, I
						chatted with Yozora and Shimada since we'll be hunting a lot together going forward! Clio
						couldn't make it tonight, but we'll be together as a static hunting group starting next week! We
						hunted Chatacabra, Quematrice, Lala Barina, and Congalala! I didn't quite get to the end of
						Chapter 1 of the main story, but we had a lot of fun talking and playing simultaneously, and
						hunting together when we were able!

						I found out after loading the game today that didn't actually finish <i>Sunset</i> last time I
						streamed, but I cleared it today! I got pretty hard stuck on the boss, but after smashing my
						head against the mechanics and getting reminded of what the in game hint was, I finally got it!
						I found out the easiest way would have been to unlike Kaede at the TV, and then use her for the
						boss fight... but I did it Tenshi-way with Coyote! I cleared <i>Cloudman</i> after, making sure
						to get some extra gachpon of Ulmeyda as souvenirs for you seeder! The boss ended up much easier
						than I expected as well. The game really feels like it's ramping up now so I can't wait to play
						more!

						Today my brain has been running with at least 5 frames of input lag. After chatting a bit, we
						swiftly moved to working on the website more! I merged the new pull requests, which fixed some
						height issues, other tweaks and fixes to the scrollbar, and added custom cursors to the website!
						After that, we added a link to a guestbook hosted on Atabook, as well as created the admin.html
						page, showing off some of the help I have around the café with a bonus webneko! After writing my
						analysis for today, we wrapped up!

						After going over this week's schedule, I merged the pull requests I received over the weekend
						from fuzzysite. This PR fixed the absolute paths in my not_found.html, as well as changed the
						scrolling for the analysis section, making hande better on the backend, and actually work on
						narrow displays! After catching up on my analysis content, I merged more pull requests. Lumi
						added a lightbox to my schedule, and fuzzy aligned my peers counter with the text. I also added
						a fix to the header for the media query, making sure the header text is not cut off on narrow
						displays. I added a new page today, info.html! After copywriting and adding a small bit of
						additional CSS for this page, I merged one last pull request for today which animates the
						background! I still need to figure out how to fix the proportions on info.html and data.html to
						match index.html, but I can't figure it out right now! BWEH!!
