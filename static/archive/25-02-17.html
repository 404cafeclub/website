						ᓚ₍ ^. .^₎ HAPPY CAT DAY ON A CATURDAY! I turned into a cat for 2.22, nya~! Today we started a
						new stream game! I was indecisive as to what game to start next on stream, and the majority of
						TenshiPlus members voted for Killer7, one of Suda51's most praised works! I've not played too
						many of his games, only a bit of No More Heroes a few years ago. Even so, I've always admired
						Suda51's style of narrative, design philosophy, and absurdist themes and plotlines! We beat the
						first two scenarios, <i>Angel</i> and <i>Sunset</i>, and then saved the game to pick up next
						week!

					<p class="analysis-heading">〚ASMR〛</p>
					<p>
						Tonight's ASMR was a special stream to show my gratitude for meeting January's TenshiPlus goal!
						Originally I wanted to do another Bar Tenshi stream this month since it's been a while, but with
						all of my coding streams and other projects in progress, I decided to do something a little
						different! I set up my ASMR mic and a handcam and we spent a cozy evening at home drinking
						together! I tried serving my umeshu a new way by pouring it over some vanilla ice cream! It
						tasted way better than I expected, so I recommend it! We ended up chatting a lot about whatever
						came to mind, topics such as anime I've been watching, goals as a performer, topics I've been
						reading out... I ended up drinking 3 glasses of umeshu mizuwari before the night wrapped up.
						You'll have to watch the VOD if you want more details eheheh~

					<p class="analysis-heading">〚404 SITEJAM〛</p>
					<p>
						Today's stream started with some conversation about the oversaturation of irony and lack of
						sincerity online! I've always strived to be sincere as much as possible online, which is irony
						in itself as an anime girl. Once we got to coding, I updated my CSS based on suggestions from
						erwinsky, added a DS style calendar thanks to fuzzysite, and additional help from clickykeys!
						After that, I finally set up my first ever GitHub! It was really confusing at first, and I'm
						still trying to figure out how pulls and pushes work, but it's nice to feel like my website is
						really collaborative now! After pulling a fix, and resolving an issue, I spent some more time
						adding updated counters and some more flair to my index.

						After catching up on general updates with ongoings on the channel and server room, I began
						workon my website! I've found it much more helpful to give myself a task list at the beginning
						of each coding session... and wish I had done that sooner since I got sidetracked really easily
						in the past. You live and you learn I guess! Today I made the not_found.html page complete with
						a very silly MS Paint drawing of a tenshi caugtht in the middle of getting dressed, and a Home
						button that I made from Nintendo sprites. I also added some more styling in CSS to align and
						flip images in the future! Lastly, my latest build was fully published to neocities for the
						world to see! Hello World!

					<p>
						Tonight's ASMR was much needed for the seeders, considering it had been almost 2 weeks since the
						last ASMR stream with a focus on relaxation. After greeting everyone, I segued into some of my
						favorite soft triggers, starting with konjac sponges, followed by lots of headpats and close
						whispers. I also let seeder lay on my lap a bit, giving them a super special ear cleaning! Sleep
						well seeder~!
