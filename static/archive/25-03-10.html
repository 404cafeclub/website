                                    That's it, you're going back to 2006 seeder! I am officially "back on my bullshit" and am playing an MMO again, but this time with fellow friends who also stream~ Today I played Final Fantasy 11 with Maple, Shimada, and Lily on stream! We've played a bit together offline, but today was our first time streaming our adventures in Vana'diel. Today we spent a while farming for Keys needed for an airship pass to Kazham. It took way longer than we expected, but we had so much fun even if only a shred of sanity was dwindling by the end. After defeating our first boss together, farming keys, and finally getting to Kazham, we made our way to Norg where I delivered an item necessary for unlocking the Ninja class (NIN). Once we split up outside of Norg, I decided to try out playing as a ninja! Before anything else, I wanted to figure out what my level 1 job ability does. I was clueless... a fool even, for not knowing sooner that the ability causes my character to self-destruct. It made for a wonderfully hilarious clip at least~! After 8 straight hours of gaming, we called it a day until we meet again next week!

                                    Happy White Day, seeder~! You got me something in exchange for the chocolates I gave you on Valentine's Day... right? Before we got to the main portion of today's stream, I played Seeder's White Day 2, a fan game made by <a href="https://fuzzysh.itch.io/seeders-white-day-2">fuzzysite</a>. It made me smile and laugh a lot, which really helped me keep my mood and energy up today. Afterwards, we moved to Killer7, Encounter 05 <i>Smile</i>, the longest chapter in the game. The game really climaxed at this point, revealing the truth behind one of the members of the Smith Syndicate, and what really happened to bring their downfall. After the credit rolled, we played through the final chapter, a very short one titled Encounter 06: <i>Lion</i>. I had to make a choice at the end... honestly, I don't know if the choice I made was the right one, but it felt right at the time. I hope you don't think of me as a monster, seeder. I had to stick with my gut! By clearing the game, we unlocked Killer8, the Hard Mode version of the game. Thanks for enjoying this surreal story from Suda51 with me! Let's explore more surrealism together~!

                                    Tonight's ASMR was a bit more abstract than my usual ASMR Roleplays, and my mood was a bit gloomy, but I was my authentic self and did my best to free myself of judgement towards my negative emotions, and chose to lean into them further when talking about life, art, and my own persuit of happiness. I was really vulnerable, but its a feeling I experience most often when I paint.

                                    HAJIME~! Today, we completed Target 04 <i>Alter Ego</i>, in Suda51's Killer7. This chapter of the game was especially enjoyable because it had a lot of original animations, in an old school tokusatsu style. We were tasked with assassinating Trevor Pearlharbor, the creator of Handsomemen, a comic pubished by ZTT comics. Rumor has it, the Handsomemen were operatives developed by the US military to fight against the Heaven Smile outbreak. After watching Handsome Black kill Trevor with a stray shot, Dan was challenged by Handsome Red in a 7 vs 7 match up against the rest of their members. The final fight was a close one, but the Killer7 reigned supreme! I was informed that next chapter in the game is a bit longer, so you'll have to tune in next time for more!

                                    After a few weeks of renovations, 404 Café reopened its doors! Today we made a fresh pot of pour-over coffee using Robusta beans with a new specialty topping, vanilla cold cream! It surely detracts from the sanctity of the beans, but it's nice to have a sweet treat from time to time! While sipping coffee, we caught up a bit since it's been quite a while since we've been able to go at a relaxed pace and just enjoy each other's company. We talked a bit about my new advancements in Japanese language learning, as well as my own mental growth from the SiteJam! The mental excercise of not knowing much about a skill, but having the drive to practice and ability to learn over time is something that I will hold close for years to come, and remind myself about when I am frustrated with my own abilities. After coffee, we looked at everyone's SiteJam participation! Some seeders made shrine pages, others personal websites, some made some cute tools, and even worked on seeder hardware! The 404 SiteJam was such a fulfilling event, and I can't wait to host something like this again in the future!
