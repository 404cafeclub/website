                                                After non-stop work on coding and at the café, it was finally time to take a break with some
                                                laid back gaming! Today we tried out AfterLove EP, a new indie game released yesterday by
                                                Pikselnesia, with art by <a href="https://x.com/soyacomu">soyatu!</a> The game follows Rama, a
                                                musician in a band with dreams of making it big. However, his girlfriend and biggest muse,
                                                Cinta, suddenly passes away, and Rama ghosts his bandmates and the world around him. The game
                                                takes place in Jakarta, so the setting was really unique! Be sure to check it out if you're
                                                interested~! We had some banter between scenes, especially about having mutual trust between
                                                myself and you seeder! Remember... if you don't trust me you might get turned into sausages!

                                                Happy Valentine's Day~! We celebrated 404 Café style with pour-over coffee and homemade
                                                chocolates! It was my first time attempting to make my own chocolates! I was about as ponkotsu
                                                as expected, and made a huge mess in the process of filling donut-shaped silicon molds with
                                                melted chocolate, as well as dipping some of my favorite Moomin buscuits in what was left! While
                                                letting them chill in the freezer, I sang some love songs for karaoke~! As I wrapped up the
                                                chocolates in a cute tenshi-style box for seeder, the stream was wrapped up as well!

                                                Today is a rare Thursday stream without ASMR! Will the seeders make it? Today I added a
                                                scrolling funtion to the "Analysis" section of the homepage. This is where each stream's events
                                                will be summarized in case someone misses one and wants a recap! I also created a new pagecalled
                                                "Data", where I've credited most of the code and assets I've used on my website thus far! We may
                                                have spent a bit too much time going down rabbit holes looking for more images, but theseeders
                                                assured me that it's all part of the process!

                                                Today, I illustrated how to rotate and squish a seeder using MSPaint. The main portion of the
                                                stream was spent on CSS styling light and dark mode for the website, linking custom fonts &amp;
                                                assets, plus structuring NAVI for additional pages. I attempted to create a blog for the
                                                website, but did not want to figure out styling for Zonelots, so I gave up for the time being.
                                                Taro visited the stream, resulting in me spilling my coffee all over my desk. My mental
                                                deteriorated from there, but progress was made!
