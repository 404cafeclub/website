		<!--This will be some more text but right now it's just filler text because I've been in VScode 
			for almost 8 hours but I want it to look nice for a screenshot so please don't actually read this portion.
			I could have just put lorem ipsum here but that wouldn't be very unique now would it, seeder? All I know is 
			how to be original and work hard, so I'll keep working hard on learning more HTML and CSS for you seeder!
			Thanks for spending so much time with me even when I'm nonverbal and feel like my brain is melting~!
			Let's keep up the hard work later this week, and hopefully by the end of the month this website will be something
			I can be proud of, and we can share for years to come... together!-->

					Today's stream started with some conversation about the oversaturation of irony and lack of
					sincerity online! I've always strived to be sincere as much as possible online, which is irony in
					itself as an anime girl. Once we got to coding, I updated my CSS based on suggestions from erwinsky,
					added a DS style calendar thanks to fuzzysite, and additional help from clickykeys! After that, I
					finally set up my first ever GitHub! It was really confusing at first, and I'm still trying to
					figure out how pulls and pushes work, but it's nice to feel like my website is really collaborative
					now! After pulling a fix, and resolving an issue, I spent some more time adding updated counters and
					some more flair to my index.
                                        </p>
                                </article>

                                        <p>
					After catching up on general updates with ongoings on the channel and server room, I began work on
					my website! I've found it much more helpful to give myself a task list at the beginning of each
					coding session... and wish I had done that sooner since I got sidetracked really easily in the past.
					You live and you learn I guess! Today I made the not_found.html page complete with a very silly MS Paint
					drawing of a tenshi caugtht in the middle of getting dressed, and a Home button that I made from
					Nintendo sprites. I also added some more styling in CSS to align and flip images in the future!
					Lastly, my latest build was fully published to neocities for the world to see! Hello World!
                                        </p>

					<p class="analysis-heading">〚ASMR〛</p>
                                        <p>
					Tonight's ASMR was much needed for the seeders, considering it had been almost 2 weeks since the
					last ASMR stream with a focus on relaxation. After greeting everyone, I segued into some of my
					favorite soft triggers, starting with konjac sponges, followed by lots of headpats and close
					whispers. I also let seeder lay on my lap a bit, giving them a super special ear cleaning! Sleep
					well seeder~!
                                        </p>

					<p class="analysis-heading">〚AFTERLOVE EP〛</p>
                                        <p>
					After non-stop work on coding and at the café, it was finally time to take a break with some laid
					back gaming! Today we tried out AfterLove EP, a new indie game released yesterday by Pikselnesia,
					with art by <a href="https://x.com/soyacomu">soyatu!</a> The game follows Rama, a musician in a band
					with dreams of making it big. However, his girlfriend and biggest muse, Cinta, suddenly passes away,
					and Rama ghosts his bandmates and the world around him. The game takes place in Jakarta, so the
					setting was really unique! Be sure to check it out if you're interested~! We had some banter between
					scenes, especially about having mutual trust between myself and you seeder! Remember... if you don't
					trust me you might get turned into sausages!
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
					Happy Valentine's Day~! We celebrated 404 Café style with pour-over coffee and homemade chocolates!
					It was my first time attempting to make my own chocolates! I was about as ponkotsu as expected, and
					made a huge mess in the process of filling donut-shaped silicon molds with melted chocolate, as well
					as dipping some of my favorite Moomin buscuits in what was left! While letting them chill in the
					freezer, I sang some love songs for karaoke~! As I wrapped up the chocolates in a cute tenshi-style
					box for seeder, the stream was wrapped up as well!
                                        </p>
                                </article>

                                        <p>
					Today is a rare Thursday stream without ASMR! Will the seeders make it? Today I added a scrolling
					funtion to the "Analysis" section of the homepage. This is where each stream's events will be
					summarized in case someone misses one and wants a recap! I also created a new page called "Data",
					where I've credited most of the code and assets I've used on my website thus far! We may have spent
					a bit too much time going down rabbit holes looking for more images, but the seeders assured me that
					it's all part of the process!
                                        </p>
                                </article>
                                <article>
					<h5>// 2.11.25 //</h5>
					<p class="analysis-heading">〚404 SITEJAM〛</p>
                                        <p>
					Today, I illustrated how to rotate and squish a seeder using MSPaint. The main portion of the stream
					was spent on CSS styling light and dark mode for the website, linking custom fonts &amp; assets,
					plus structuring NAVI for additional pages. I attempted to create a blog for the website, but did
					not want to figure out styling for Zonelots, so I gave up for the time being. Taro visited the
					stream, resulting in me spilling her coffee all over my desk. My mental deteriorated from there, but
					progress was made!
                                        </p>
